1. A snowball is stuck if any two neighboring sides are blocked by a wall or obstacles. 
For example, the snowball is at the corner, or the snowball has a wall to the right and an obstacle at the top.

2. A snowball cannot reach the goal if it is located beside a wall and the goal is not beside that wall becuase snowballs beside a wall can only move alongside the wall.

3. Prune as soon as an impossible state caused by the mentioned above is reached to save computation time.

4. It takes extra steps to move stacked snowballs, so it is a great idea to reflect this on the manhattan distance by multiplying the distance.

5. Check whether the snowball is at the destination first to avoid unnecessary computations.
